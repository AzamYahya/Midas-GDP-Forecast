# Midas-GDP-Forecast

My senior project; Forecasting Turkey real GDP growth using mixed frequency data sampling regression model. Based on a recent [paper](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index.php/jss/article/view/v072i04 "Mixed Frequency Data Sampling Regression Models: The R Package midasr") on Journal of Statistical Software, I applied mixed data frequency regression to our problem using R. I believe this can be used for government and other companies who need accurate gdp forecast. More importantly, concept of midas regression can be applied to all sort of problems.
