# Midas-GDP-Forecast

My senior project; Forecasting Turkey real GDP growth using mixed frequency data sampling regression model. Based on a recent paper on Journal of Statistical Software, I applied mixed data frequency regression to our problem using R. I believe this can be used for government and other componies who need accurate gdp forecast.
